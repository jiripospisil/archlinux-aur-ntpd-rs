# Changes in version 1.2.3

Fixed:

- Metrics exporter should wait for an actual request before sending a response


# Changes in version 1.2.2

Changed:

- Updated dependencies

Fixed:

- Fixed a bug in network change detection that prevented startup on FreeBSD.
- Fixed a bug in leap second flag handling where previous flags weren't
  explicitly unset.
- Fixed a bug that caused NTS-KE sessions from clients with a large request to

# Changes in version 1.2.1 (nuked)

Changed:

- Updated dependencies

Fixed:

- Fixed a bug in network change detection that prevented startup on FreeBSD
- Fixed a bug in leap second flag handling where previous flags weren't
  explicitly unset.


# Changes in version 1.2.0

Added:

- Pool mode sources can be set up to ignore some addresses returned by the pool
- NTP sources use a random client port for every request sent
- The metrics exporter will keep trying to startup while its network interface
  is not yet available
- Added option for server to only respond to NTS messages.

Changed:

- Updated dependencies
- ntp-udp and ntp-os-clock were replaced by timestamped-socket and
  clock-steering
- Minor improvements to NTS keyset storage errors
- Loop detection is handled globally instead of per source
- The MSRV was raised to 1.70
- The metrics exporter is better able to handle multiple simultaneous
  connections
- Pendulum is now part of Trifecta Tech Foundation (copyright was updated)
- Large parts of the daemon code have been refactored to simplify the code

Fixed:

- Metrics would not synchronize if the metrics data was too large
- ntpd-rs would ignore responses from servers implementing NTPv3


# Changes in version 1.1.3

Fixed:

- Unlimited number of NTS-KE connections could crash ntpd-rs server
  (CVE-2024-38528)


# Changes in version 1.1.2

Fixed:

- Fixed tests in ntp-proto to also work outside the repository

# Changes in version 1.1.1

Added:

- A work in progress implementation for experimental NTS pools was added

Changed:

- Updated dependencies

Fixed:

- Fixed missing newline at the end of the prometheus metrics export
- Fixed error handling on NTS key exchange sessions
- Small fixes to the experimental NTPv5 draft support


# Changes in version 1.1.0

Added:

- Server can now be run without permission to change the system clock so long as
  no time sources are configured.
- Experimental NTPv5 draft support was added behind a feature flag (disabled by
  default)

Changed:

- The sources section can be left out of the configuration now.
- When no sources are configured, the daemon will merely state it won't change
  system time, rather than warn
- The MSRV was raised to 1.67
